#returns a TRUE and FALSE vector. True when nm (or rowname) that follows the pattern in "grep"
# "%in%" is a logical operator. grep function is selects values of nm that starts with M.
# value: if FALSE, a vector containing the (integer) indices of the matches determined by grep is returned. 
# value: if TRUE, a vector containing the matching elements themselves is returned.

start_with_M <- nm %in% grep("^M", nm, value = TRUE)
start_with_M

#selects values of state.x77 that is TRUE in "start_with_M". 
#The third argument (Illiteracy:Murder) specifies the variables to be selected.
#The pattern in selecting specific states that starts with M is:
#1) use %in% (logical operator) and grep (fcn) to create a TRUE and FALSE vector, TRUE if the state starts with M and FALSE if otherwise
#2) use subset to use the TRUE and FALSE vector to select all states are "TRUE"
#It's like getting the subset of state.x77 and start_with_M = TRUE

subset(state.x77, start_with_M, Illiteracy:Murder)

# but in recent versions of R this can simply be

start_with_M2<- subset(state.x77, grepl("^M", nm), Illiteracy:Murder)
start_with_M2

#whew!!!
