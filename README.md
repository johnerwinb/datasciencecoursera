Progamming assignment for R Programming (Coursera, John Hopkins University))
This repo will include all R Programming solutions with commentaries.
My aim is 1) to learn in deeper detail the codes I forked in order to complete the course;
2) provide a venue for other courserans to view my work;
3) demonstrate how to learn R programming my way - that is, dissecting, isolating, and experimenting on codes to understand what it does.

"Enjoy learning!" "Enjoy forking!"
